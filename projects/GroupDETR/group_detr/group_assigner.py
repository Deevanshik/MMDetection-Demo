    """Group-Wise One-to-Many Assignment.Computes one-to-one matching between
    predictions and ground truth in group.

    This class computes an assignment between the targets and the predictions
    based on the costs. The costs are weighted sum of some components.
    For DETR the costs are weighted sum of classification cost, regression L1
    cost and regression iou cost. The targets don't include the no_object, so
    generally there are more predictions than targets. After the one-to-one
    matching, the un-matched are treated as backgrounds. Thus each query
    prediction will be assigned with `0` or a positive integer indicating the
    ground truth index:

    - 0: negative sample, no assigned gt
    - positive integer: positive sample, index (1-based) of assigned gt
